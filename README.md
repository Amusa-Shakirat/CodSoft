CodSoft Internship Project
Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Project repository! During my internship with CodSoft, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects aimed at honing my skills in Java programming and software development. This repository contains the code for five tasks I completed during my internship:

Number Game: A Java application that generates random numbers and challenges users to guess the correct number within a specified range.

Student Calculator: This project involves creating a Java application for performing various calculations related to student grades and academic performance.

ATM Interface: An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface implemented in Java, simulating the functionality of a real ATM by allowing users to perform operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and checking balances.

Currency Converter: A Java application that enables users to convert between different currencies, incorporating exchange rates from external APIs.

Student Management System: A comprehensive Java application for managing student-related information, including features such as adding, editing, and deleting student records, managing courses, and tracking attendance. This project also involves the use of JavaFX for the user interface.

Major Challenges
Throughout the internship, I encountered several challenges, with the most significant ones revolving around:

Working with External APIs: Implementing the Currency Converter required interfacing with external APIs to fetch accurate exchange rates.

JavaFX Usage: Developing the user interface for the Student Management System using JavaFX posed a learning curve as it was my first experience with the framework.

Despite these challenges, I was able to overcome them through perseverance, resourcefulness, and leveraging available documentation and online resources.

Getting Started
To explore the code for each project, simply navigate to the respective directories in this repository. Each project directory contains the source code files along with any necessary documentation or instructions.

Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to CodSoft for providing me with the opportunity to undertake this internship and to my mentors for their guidance and support throughout the internship period.
